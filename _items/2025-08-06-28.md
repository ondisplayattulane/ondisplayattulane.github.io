## About the Work

_Connecting With Yourself_ explores the journey of turning inward after rejection. This painting reflects that vulnerable, yet empowering processâ€”finding strength and clarity in solitude. Self Healing!

## About the Artist

Emre Karaoglu, a contemporary figurative artist from Turkey now based in New Orleans, uses oil, pastel & charcoal portraits to capture the profound layers of human experience within everyday life. Emre's art practice positions him as both an observer and archivist of modern culture, bearing witness to the lives and emotions of his subjects. For Emre, painting the human form offers a doorway into exploring the depth and complexity of the struggles woven into daily existence.
