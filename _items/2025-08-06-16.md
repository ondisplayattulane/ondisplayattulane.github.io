## About the Work

Rejection is possible at every stage of the artistic process. Artists have always developed personas to soften the impact of exposure, but audiences today see through persona. I’ve painted over many of my paintings, and there is a great relief when I do. Occasionally, someone tells me they loved the painting that I painted over, and I feel regret along with relief. This piece reflects the exposure of showing the most vulnerable parts of myself through art. 

## About the Artist

Devin Hammons is an artist based in New Orleans. Working mostly in the traditional medium of oil paint, Hammons imparts a sense of the uncanny into interior spaces. By subverting the viewer’s expectations of familiarity, Hammons’s work plays lightly with rejection– which the artist calls “the wonderful jolt of unrecognition.” Hammon pushes this theme further in repaintings, which the artist notes can stir feelings of loss in viewers who appreciated previous iterations. However, this process of rejection and transformation also brings to light the myriad ways in which artworks can be accepted or rejected throughout the artistic process.
