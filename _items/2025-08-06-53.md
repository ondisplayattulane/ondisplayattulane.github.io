## About the Work

These pieces have been rejected from group shows. I’ve told myself it was because the colors didn’t match the group or the curator had a different vision. I get that my work can be a bit confusing, it blends different spaces into a dream-like place for the mind to wander. I love starting with collage; it adds energy and unpredictablity to a composition. It usually presents interesting questions of how I seamlessly blend one image into another. People have said there's “too much going on,” in my composition. I understand this criticism, but in my work I'm trying to capture the holistic nature of an experience. My work reflects the chaos and depth of our ever changing world.
