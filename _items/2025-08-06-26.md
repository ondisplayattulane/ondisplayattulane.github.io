## About the Work

I Wish You Were Here is a reflection on the quiet ache of rejectionâ€”the absence of someone once hoped for, imagined, or longed for. In this painting, I explore the emotional residue left behind when connection is denied. Pain!

## About the Artist

Emre Karaoglu, a contemporary figurative artist from Turkey now based in New Orleans, uses oil, pastel & charcoal portraits to capture the profound layers of human experience within everyday life. Emre's art practice positions him as both an observer and archivist of modern culture, bearing witness to the lives and emotions of his subjects. For Emre, painting the human form offers a doorway into exploring the depth and complexity of the struggles woven into daily existence.
