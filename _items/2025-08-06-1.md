## About the Work

Protesting the political stomp that the powers that be does to silence dissent.

## About the Artist

Arturo Pérez Saad, a multi-disciplinary artist. His pictorial work is a celebration of nature, the figure and life. His work reflects the innate quest of exploiting dualities: the “micro” world and the “macro” world while fusing them together with complexities of sentiment, movement, dance and music. Using vivid color, light and surface texture as a form of expression.  BA & BS, University of New Orleans. MFA, Pratt Institute. Arturo is a contemporary Puerto Rican-Lebanese artist, who has called New Orleans home since 1984.  

This current body of work submitted to Newcomb to be included in the _Salon des Refusés_ is about overcoming rejection in his personal life. In his artistic professional life applying to exhibitions of “New Orleans based artists” an inclusion process thought to be simple, barriers arise and few opportunities avail themselves.
