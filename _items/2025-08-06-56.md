## About the Artist

Sofia Olexia-Daigle (she/they) is an artist dedicated to uplifting women of all backgrounds, celebrating their strength, identity, and shared experiences. A Louisiana native, she draws inspiration from the natural environment, often incorporating wetlands and wildlife into her work, as well as the community and historical impacts on the city. Her artwork demonstrates a shared value and morals between women—frequently combined with glass, ceramics and mixed media—reflect themes of womanhood, caregiving, and societal barriers. Through critical reflection, she explores how identity and systemic challenges shape lives. Her work embraces diversity across race, body type, and gender identity. Sofia’s ultimate goal is for viewers to see themselves in her art and feel understood, valued, and connected through shared humanity.
