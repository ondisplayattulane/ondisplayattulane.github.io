## About the Artist

Charles Anderson is a painter working in New Orleans and out of his home studio in Chalmette. Anderson’s work aims to bring light to stories that are not typically featured in conventional gallery spaces. He weaves together activism and storytelling by featuring themes such as gun violence and school expulsion and social and economic marginalization. These traumatic events are part of the lived experience of many people, but often the art market’s heterodoxy rejects Anderson’s work– mirroring the delegitimation of the people whose stories he tells. However, his work also provides a counternarrative: there are members of society who will always lend an ear- or a paint brush- to witness stories of adversity and personal triumph in the face of systemic challenge.
