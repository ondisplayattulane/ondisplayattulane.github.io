## About the Work

Nguyen was just as inspired by the anatomy of the figure in that particular pose and used it in her own work. _Blue Moon_ was made in reference to Johnson's figure, _The Voice of Q_. 

## About the Artist

DUYEN NGUYEN’s work synthesizes representation and abstraction in embroidered paintings and works on paper where energy is made visible and characters—animal, human and plant—co-exist in spontaneous environments. Nguyen’s expressionistic style, the ease with which she works various materials, and her willingness to experiment with media, foster the creation of mysterious places, and otherworldly moods. Nguyen’s artwork reflects her interests in beauty, folklore, and Vietnamese culture. DUYEN NGUYEN is an ambitious visionary artist raised on a small commune in Vung Tau Province, Vietnam. Duyen spent her childhood drawing and hand sewing at night. Nguyen’s work is featured in several private collections throughout the United States. She has created over 1000 artworks, clothing designs and collaborative paintings with her husband since she moved to the United States in 2016. Duyen has exhibited her work at the State Museum of Pennsylvania, The 6 th Louisiana Biennial National Exhibition in Rustin Louisiana, Art Flow22 and 24 in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana Contemporary Exhibition at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans.
