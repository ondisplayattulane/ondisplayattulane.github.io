## About the Work

The elements of this work were originally created by Julie Glass as a 3D steel and resin sculpture inspired by satellite maps of the 'toe of the boot' of Louisiana. This sculpture was shown at the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum in 2021. However, Glass later decided the sculpture was inelegant and proceeded to dissect the sculpture. In this case, the parts are greater and more interesting than the whole. In response to this call, the parts were then arranged on a gray canvas covering a previously rejected abstract painting underneath.

## About the Artist

Julie Glass is a self-taught sculptor working in wood, steel, plexiglass and textiles. She has exhibited at museums, galleries and other venues in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Monroe, Alexandria, Hammond and Waveland. Glass is interested in the intersection of materials, processes, visuals, and ideas. Her work is inspired by ideas such as quantum physics, in which parallel universes, and thus infinite possibilities, could exist.  Her wood collage work allows for infinite combinations of colors, patterns and ideas. It also allows for continued addition, subtraction and revision.
