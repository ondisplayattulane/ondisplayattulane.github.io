## About the Work

This collage was a challenge to step away from known subjects being the focus of a collage, The contents of this collage come from the contents of my recycling bin and scrap box, to recreate purpose and permanence what we consume on a daily basis and then forget. My goal was to deconstruct each item to void its function and reimagine its form as well as to question what materials can be considered art. I chose to go beyond the typical rectangular limits of paper to reject its boundary of the collage substrate itself.
