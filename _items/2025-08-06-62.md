## About the Work

In this work, I examine the negative space left when someone leaves, the way relationships evolve when left unattended, and the act of transitioning through a liminal space that we seldom acknowledge and never intend to stay in. The photographs look inward, reflecting on our struggle to imagine alternative ways of living and what care looks like in community. These intimate, personal documentations of love, loss, solitude, and reflection suggest that care might start with dwelling in the discomfort.
