## About the Work

_In Thoughts_ captures the internal echo of rejection—the moments replayed, the words unsaid, the weight of being left behind. The piece invites viewers into the quiet intensity of emotional processing, where what’s felt is often louder than what’s spoken. Vulnerability!

## About the Artist

Emre Karaoglu, a contemporary figurative artist from Turkey now based in New Orleans, uses oil, pastel & charcoal portraits to capture the profound layers of human experience within everyday life. Emre's art practice positions him as both an observer and archivist of modern culture, bearing witness to the lives and emotions of his subjects. For Emre, painting the human form offers a doorway into exploring the depth and complexity of the struggles woven into daily existence.
