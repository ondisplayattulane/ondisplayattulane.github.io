## About the Work

My series engages with the theme of rejection through both conceptual and material means. These images live in a space where the gaze falters, recognition slips and the image resists being known. Each image rejects the traditional expectations of portraiture and visibility. These choices reject the demand for clarity, identity, and narrative legibility often placed on visual representation. In doing so, the works question what must be seen to be validated or perceived. They reflect my own moments of rejecting tradition within the medium of photography, allowing for the image to reveal something truer than technical perfection. Through embracing what might otherwise be overlooked by an artist, these images speak to the power in choosing to refuse legibility, reject standards, and allow the imperfect to be a means of understanding what perfection fails to portray.
