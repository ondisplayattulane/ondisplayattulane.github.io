## About the Artist

Eliza Mai Hinrichs was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Her mother was the first person to put a paintbrush in her hand, introducing her to the arts at a very young age. Since then, Eliza has had many creative endeavors, and ultimately, painting became the major force in her creative language. She is driven by curiosity and inspired by all the colors and textures existing within the small intricacies of the world. Beyond painting, Eliza works as a pattern designer and studio assistant. She is a NOCCA alum, currently earning her BFA in painting at University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Her work has been shown in the Contemporary Arts Center, the Acadiana Center for the Arts, University of Louisiana at Lafayetteâ€™s Fletcher Hall, The Hallway Gallery, Tulane's Newcomb Art Center as well as other galleries and publications.
