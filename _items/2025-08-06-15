## About This Item

This is a mixed-media collage with geopolitical lines, drawings of fireflies, and pasted grocery store promotions.

## From the Contributor

'Detritus: Acadiana' is made from trash. It's an assemblage of rejected scraps that's about a place colonized by rejected people whose descendants have rejected the wisdom of their ancestors and are now in the process of being rejected once again, by Mother Nature this time. And in more of a literal sense, it's been rejected by both shows and buyers. This collage is part of a larger series called 'Detritus' that seeks to make life legible. I make them from trash and scraps of paper that I collect. This makes them contextual manifests of a specific time, place, and people, kind of like the walls of a bar bathroom or the eroded steps of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The collage is just the record of the real work - the act of living.
