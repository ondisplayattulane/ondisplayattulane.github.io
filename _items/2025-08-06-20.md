## About the Work

Tapping into street photography’s history of valuing the ordinary and overlooked, Elsey upholds the sometimes-rejected as apt subjects for art. Although he understands his images as capturing life in Baton Rouge, he finds his work rejected and out of place when he features it on social media. The juxtaposition between Elsey’s image of a dead hog and the curated perfection found online amplifies the alienation many feel from social media. Ultimately, this prompts the viewer to ask themself, “Am I also a dead hog?”
