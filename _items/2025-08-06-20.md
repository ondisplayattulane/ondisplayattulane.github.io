## About the Work

As someone who has never had work exhibited or even considered, my concepts of rejection and acceptance as it pertains to art come exclusively from social media. When I walked into work and came upon a dead hog, hanging behind the engine bay, I knew I had to get pictures of it. Instagram is typically filled with perfect images of perfect people, so I figured that a B&W picture of dead hog might be strange to come across. I posted it anyways, and felt better about my body of work regardless of any negative feedback.
