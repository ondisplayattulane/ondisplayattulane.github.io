## About the Work

This work uses text taken from anonymous, now-defunct 'Whisper' app posts overlaid on a thermographic mapping of the body to communicate how shame and secrecy manifest malignantly in our bodies- in this example, in the hips or womb. There is no way to know where the secrets shared led, or where the posters are now. Do they hold shame still? The 'Whisper' app posts explore the secrecy and anonymity that characterized the culture of the early internet in a manner that only those who experienced that age of social media can empathize with, creating a barrier for entry to reception in other gallery spaces.

## About the Artist

Carmen Alcocer is a senior studying Studio Art, Art History, and Latin American Studies. Much of her art explores connections between corporatism, desire, and self-definition, and how consumer culture can serve as a vehicle for human connection and expression.
