## About the Work

My art thrives on rejection and questions what constitutes real art. I create from the outside of social boundaries. Beyond these ramparts is a place of sanctuary and growth, rooted in my self-taught methods, which are reflected in this series of paintings that critique status quo absurdities. This series embodies how materialism masks insecurity: Ford F150 exposes the patriarchal obsession with domination that acts as a stand-in for confidence; Narcissism eventually comes to light and the portraitâ€™s black teeth reveal the symbiosis of cruelty and self-sabotage; finally, Acceptance honors individuality and urges that we love ourselves and each other for our uniqueness. Just as acceptance celebrates authenticity, I want my art to encourage others to explore their true creative selves without judgement or fear.
