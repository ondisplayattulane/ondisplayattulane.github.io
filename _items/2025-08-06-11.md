## About the Work

Tuna Christ is a collage bearing the dimensions of a bluefin tuna, wounded by fishing lures. The viewer is invited to gently pull the lures to reveal ribbons bearing Bible verses referencing fish. Tuna Christ is not intended as a mockery; instead, I wanted to use this allegory to prompt the viewer to examine how they perceive and interact with their own beliefs. Traditional gallery spaces viewed the interactive nature of this piece, alongside its fragility, as a risk. But there must be space for risk in art, and openness to the change that human interaction can create.

## About the Artist

Carmen Alcocer is a senior studying Studio Art, Art History, and Latin American Studies. Much of her art explores connections between corporatism, desire, and self-definition, and how consumer culture can serve as a vehicle for human connection and expression.
