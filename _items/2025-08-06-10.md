## About the Work

I created this piece alongside a term paper exploring Mesoamerican language and symbolism, specifically that of the Maya and the Mexica. The work stands in contrast to my more public-facing portfolio, and I was never able to find the words or space to justify its display in a gallery or show. However, the experience of learning through painting and the parallel research that produced both this painting and my final paper was an incredibly gratifying and informative experience.

## About the Artist

Carmen Alcocer is a senior studying Studio Art, Art History, and Latin American Studies. Much of her art explores connections between corporatism, desire, and self-definition, and how consumer culture can serve as a vehicle for human connection and expression.
