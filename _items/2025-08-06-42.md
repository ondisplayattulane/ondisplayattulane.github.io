## About the Work

My digital collages reflect my latest experience with rejection: Although they were not selected for another exhibition, they serve as a reminder of the need for perseverance. These collages illustrate the colorful yet remote emotional landscape of being an outsider. They evoke a dream in the middle of a nightmare. I’ve been reflecting on how power structures distort our minds with falsehoods and seek to destroy our connections. These artworks resist today’s divisiveness and cultural erasure by centering the sacredness of nature, self-reflection, and interconnectedness. I avoid planning the composition, allowing the imagery to emerge raw, uncanny, and honest.
