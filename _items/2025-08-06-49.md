## About the Work

I made this Paul Sellers design router plane from all recycled materials. I was determined to make my own blade. It resulted in the blade not being the proper dimensions and the plane not working properly. It was rejected by me as not being a properly working tool. I kept it as a reminder of the learning experience and my efforts.
