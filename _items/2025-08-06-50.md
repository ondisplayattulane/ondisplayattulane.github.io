## About the Work

I submitted this painting to several exhibitions, and it has already been rejected twice: once in April, once in May. I didn’t take it personally. Some things are meant to sit quietly in the corner for a while. / In the image, a girl leans over a red box. Inside, there’s a small mountain covered in fog. It looks like a bonsai, or maybe a memory that someone tried to prune but couldn’t. This box holds fragments of longing, unfinished thoughts, and emotions left unexpressed. As an artist, I often reject what I make, discarding early versions, struggling against materials that resist my intent. / There are scissors on the table, and a piece of paper that used to mean something. They suggest something has been trimmed away, either from life or from memory. This work embodies a private kind of refusal: the kind that unfolds within the artist’s own process, and within the emotional interiority of the figure herself.
