## About the Work

This drawing, created during my first steps into figure drawing, represents the awkward, honest stage of beginningâ€”a stage rarely given space on gallery walls, even when asked for. It was rejected, I believe, not because it lacked sincerity or presence, but because galleries that claim to welcome artists of all levels often have unspoken expectations. They appear inclusive, but in practice they lean toward more polished or technically refined work.
