## About the Work

Last year, after six years away, I traveled to Cuba to participate in a group exhibition with former classmates from the National Academy of Fine Arts. The theme was open, so I chose to exhibit my painting Hurricane Season, which explores Cuban immigration caused by the lack of freedom of expression. In the piece, royal palms—symbols of Cuban identity—are shown leaving the land and heading into a stormy sea, representing uncertain exile. A crumbling red wall with a fence suggests a barren homeland that must be abandoned for freedom, while a floating church symbolizes the loss of faith. The gallery’s curators interpreted the message clearly and rejected the work, stating it went against the values and principles of the Cuban government. I was informed that _Hurricane Season_ could not be shown in Cuba because it conveyed ideas contrary to those of the Cuban Revolution.
