## About the Work

At the time this painting was created I felt that I did not have a voice to express who I was and what I was trying to say with my work. I felt rejected by society and had a lot of fear about being myself. I see this painting as embarrassingly personal and awkward and thus I personally rejected it as not one of my best paintings in this series. I feel this painting speaks to this present political moment with the shutting down DEI and condemning of LGBTQ people. I am afraid to be me and fear being rejected.
